If you select `ipmitool` as your default provider, there's an issue
that might bite you. The Gem that's used to interact with `ipmitool`
has a bug for which there's a fix but no stable release has been
released for years now containing it.

When Foreman calls `/bmc/X.X.X.X/lan/foo` (typically when a host with
BMC interface is browsed), the proxy might enter an infinite loop if
the BMC is not working, provoking a huge process creation/destruction
rate, high system CPU use and high system load as consequence.

See Foreman issue
[#20977](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/20977) for more
details.
